% 'loss').
%
%
% Model Computation
% =================
%
% The goal of BCI research is to enable a computer system to read the ongoing EEG (or other
% brain-/biosignals) of a person and predict from it, in real time, what his/her cognitive state is.
% Since the connection between biosignals and cognitive state includes some information that is
% highly specific to a person or group of persons, it can only be obtained from actual data of that
% person (or group), which is here called a 'calibration data set'. For modern expositions of the
% general problem and solutions, see [7] or [8].
%
% There is currently no general automated method to learn the connection (relation) between a
% calibration data set and the aspect of cognitive state that is to be predicted,  but there is a
% growing body of approaches, here called 'paradigms', each of which imposes a different set of
% assumptions about the nature of that relation. These paradigms tend to perform well if their
% assumptions match the data and if the required information is sufficiently accessible in the
% calibration data set. The result is a 'predictive model' in which the information about the
% connection of interest is captured (usually in some form of statistical mapping).
%
% Almost all paradigms involve some parameters that can be varied to obtain a different variant of
% the paradigm (e.g., the frequency range of interest in the EEG signal), and the better these
% parameters are chosen, the better will be the attainable quality of the models that the paradigm
% can compute. In addition, there is the possibility to search over different values of parameters
% to find a good combination, if allowed by compute/time resources.
%
% bci_train requires that at least a paradigm is specified (predefined ones are in code/paradigms)
% and that a calibration data set, annotated with expected cognitive state is supplied. Since
% bci_train must learn a relation between raw signal and abstract (human-defined) cognitive state,
% the state must be specified by the user in a machine-accessible format. A typical 'encoding' of
% such state is created as follows. The user records a calibration data set from a person (a regular
% EEG recording). Througout this recording, the person is in different states at different times
% (preferably repeatedly and randomized), for example, instructed to think or feel a sequence of
% specific things (e.g., imagine a left/right hand gesture), or exposed to a series of artificial
% conditions (e.g., high/low excitement), such that the answer to a particular state question is
% known at particular times in the recording (e.g. was a left or right hand gesture being imagined
% at time X?). The times at which there is knowledge about the person's state, and its value at
% these times is encoded into the EEG as 'events', or 'markers'. In EEGLAB data sets, this is the
% field EEG.event, and its type (a string) would be used to encode the state value. Usually, events
% are produced by the software that guides the person though the calibration session and are
% recorded by the data acquisition system.
%
% Which events in the data set are relevant and what is the desired output of the BCI for each of
% these events of interest is specified via the parameter TargetMarkers (or may also be added as an
% annotation for the data itself, using set_targetmarkers).
%
% Aside from the chosen paradigm's parameters, this is all there is to specify to bci_train in order
% to obtain a predictive model and its performance estimate. The paradigm's parameters are all
% optional, and are by default set as in the representative (or most commonly) published use of the
% paradigm, so most of them need to be specified only when the user wants to deviate from those
% values.
%
%
% Simple Example
% ==============
%
% A model that predicts the laterality of imagined hand gestures can be computed as follows
% (assuming that the data set contains events with types 'left-imag' and 'right-imag', at the time
% points where the subject was instructed to imagine the respective action). Since the relevant
% brain signals (Event-Related Desynchronization, see [1]) are assumed to be oscillatory processes
% that originate in distinct areas of the brain, the CSP (Common Spatial Pattern, see, e.g., [2])
% paradigm is used here unmodified. The approach can be specified as a string (usually the acronym
% for one of the ParadigmXXX.m files in code/paradigms) or as a cell array containing that string
% followed by optional name-value pairs to override/customize parameters.
%
%   calib = io_loadset('data_sets/john/gestures.eeg')
%   [loss,model,stats] = bci_train('Data',calib, 'Approach','CSP', 'TargetMarkers',{'left-imag','right-imag'})
%
% When the loss is good (low) enough to justify online use, the model would then be loaded by the
% user into BCILAB's online system and would predict, whenever it receives EEG that indicates an
% imagined left hand gesture, the number 1 with high probability (and 2 with low probability), and
% in the case of an imagined right hand gesture, the number 2 with high probability (and 1 with low
% probability). At times where the person being measured imagines neither of the defined gestures,
% the system may produce arbitrary predictions. To handle such cases, a further condition (the
% 'rest' condition) can be defined for the model, by inserting 'rest' events into the data set
% whenever the subject was in neither of the two other states. The model could then be trained as
%
%   [loss,model,stats] = bci_train('Data',calib, 'Approach','CSP', 'TargetMarkers',{'left-imag','right-imag','rest'}),
%
% and would predict 3 with high probability (and 1/2 with low probability) in periods where the
% person being measured is in a resting state (note: the function set_insert_markers can be used to
% insert markers of given types into specific periods of the data). Since CSP is by nature a method
% defined for only two conditions, the framework automatically applies it on every pair of
% conditions, which is called voting (see ml_trainvote). Another way to obtain similar results is by
% using two separate models at the same time, one to detect the type of imagination, and the other
% to detect whether an imagination (defined as a group of multiple event types) or resting is
% happening:
%
%   [lossA,modelA] = bci_train('Data',calib, 'Approach','CSP', 'TargetMarkers',{'left-imag','right-imag'}),
%   [lossB,modelB] = bci_train('Data',calib, 'Approach','CSP', 'TargetMarkers',{'rest', {'left-imag','right-imag'}})
%
% Though, in this case it is up to the application to combine the state probabilities that are
% produced by model B with those produced by model A.
%
% The majority of approaches override at least one parameter of the paradigm, as for example the
% EpochExtraction parameter of the signal processing chain, which determines the time range of
% interest relative to the events. Thus, calibration of a BCI model usually proceeds in three steps
% in BCILAB:
%
%   calib = io_loadset('data_sets/john/gestures.eeg')
%   myapproach = {'CSP', 'SignalProcessing',{'EpochExtraction',[0.5 2.5]}};
%   [loss,model,stats] = bci_train('Data',calib, 'Approach',myapproach, 'TargetMarkers',{'left-imag','right-imag'})
%
%
% Loss Estimation
% ===============
%
% The most important question to ask about a predictive model is how well it performs, i.e. how well
% do its outputs match the desired outputs -- and for a complete system that performs actions
% depending on a predictive model, what overall cost is incurred by (potentially sub-optimal)
% behavior of the system. Both cases can be covered by a formal 'loss' metric [3]. Different types
% of systems / types of predictive models require different loss metrics, which can be chosen in the
% EvaluationMetric parameter from a set of pre-defined ones, or supplied as a custom function. An
% introduction to various predefined loss functions and their uses is given in the help of the
% function machine_learning/ml_calcloss.
%
% The loss of a model can be computed in a variety of settings. Most obviously and realistically, a
% model can be run online, and the loss incurred by its predictions can be recorded (for example,
% number of mis-classifications, virtual money lost by a BCI-supported gamer). This, however,
% requires multiple (controlled) runs through an experiment to compare different models and/or
% methods, which is usually prohibitively costly. A more effective approach is to record the online
% EEG/biosignal data and the desired outputs of the system whenever they are known, and then
% estimate the loss of any models "offline" on the data, using the loss metric that best reflects
% the actual loss in the chosen scenario (for example mis-classification rate or ROC area); this
% approach requires just one session, and can be used to compare arbitrarily many models post-hoc
% (using the function bci_predict). The caveat is that any chaotic dynamics that may unfold between
% a system mis-behaving and a user reacting are not covered by the estimate (for example, when a
% system fails for more than a minute, the user may start to control it more aggressively, which may
% in turn make it even more difficult for the model to interpret brain signals).
%
% Finally, a loss estimate can be computed directly by bci_train, on the given calibration data,
% using cross-validation (CV) [4]. This is a data resampling procedure in which models are
% repeatedly computed, each time on a different subset of the data (called the training set) and
% compared on another disjoint portion of the data (called the test set) using the defined (i.e.
% desired) outputs, and some user-selected loss measure. In the default CV, the data is partitioned
% into 10 blocks, where for each block, a model is computed on the remaining 9 ones and tested
% against the target values in the current block (called 10-fold blockwise CV). Other variants
% include k-fold randomized CV, where the data trials are randomly shuffled before a regular
% blockwise k-fold CV, n times repeated k-fold CV, in which n repeated runs over different
% shufflings are executed and results averaged, and leave-one-out CV (LOOCV), where a model is
% computed on all except for one trial, and is then tested on the held-out trial. The loss measure
% is by default chosen depending on the type of target values in the calibration set and the
% features of the paradigm so that the user rarely needs to override it (misclassification rate for
% categorical outputs, mean-square error for continuous outputs, negative log-likelihood for
% probabilistic regression models, etc.).
%
% The loss estimates of bci_train are very convenient and can be used to evaluate a large variety of
% models on data from a single calibration session. The caveat is that that the estimate
% systematically fails to cover certain features of actual online situations. First, chaotic
% dynamics are not captured, as in the other offline case, and second, only a certain fraction of
% the (time-varying) non-stationarities in the data are captured by the estimate. Most biosignals
% contain features that vary at certain time scales, from second to second (e.g., dopamine level),
% minute to minute (e.g., background situation), hour to hour (e.g., tiredness), day to day (e.g.,
% medication) and year to year (e.g., long-term brain plasticity), all of which can affect the
% output (quality) of the model. Since calibration sessions are usually short, training/test data is
% close to each other in time, and the situation typically has little variation (e.g. it may be all
% offline with no user control involved), the majority of non-stationarities that could degrade the
% model's performance are not captured, and the estimate is almost surely overly optimistic. How
% large this effect is depends among others on the stability of the features used by the model, the
% strength of assumptions imposed by the paradigm, and the variety/coverage of situations present in
% the calibration data.
%
%
% Paradigm Customization and Structure
% ====================================
%
% In the Approach declaration, a list of name-value pairs can be specified, for example
% {'CSP', 'Resampling',200, 'SpectralSelection',[7 30], 'EpochExtraction',[-1.5 2.5]}, to override the
% default values of the chosen paradigm for the given named parameters - practically all paradigms have
% named parameters (although some community-supplied ones may have position-dependent parameters -
% like most MATLAB functions). All parameters are basically passed through unmodified to the
% paradigm in question (usually one of the paradigms/ParadigmXXX classes), so the place to
% look up what can be specified is the help of the respective class, or by bringing up the GUI config
% dialog for the given approach (see GUI tutorial).
%
% Most paradigms contain similar internal structure, and therefore share common components, which in
% turn means that most of them share multiple common parameters. It is therefore helpful to know
% these components. The internal structure of most paradigms contains a sequence of three overall
% data processing stages. The first stage, Signal Processing, receives (multi-channel) signals, such
% as EEG, and filters these signals to amplify and focus the information of interest, and to discard
% the remaining information. The outputs of the first stage are again signals, either continuous or
% epoched/segmented. The stage may have several successive sub-steps (most of them called filters,
% some called data set editing operations), such as resampling, frequency filtering, spatial
% filtering, time window selection, artifact removal, etc.. The toolbox offers a collection of
% pre-defined filter components (in filters/flt_*) and data set operations (in dataset_ops/set_*),
% each with their respective default parameters. Most paradigms use at least one or two of these
% components, usually with custom parameters for them, and the user can override these parameters by
% specifying the component name (e.g. 'resample' to control the settings of the used sampling rate
% filter, flt_resample) followed by the parameter value to be passed (e.g. 200 for 200 Hz in the
% case of flt_resample), or a cell array of parameters if the component accepts multiple parameters,
% such as flt_ica does. Furthermore, most paradigms not only use a subset of the provided filters,
% but instead use the entire default Signal Processing pipeline of the toolbox, explained in
% filters/flt_pipeline. For this reason, all parameters of flt_pipeline can be customized by the
% user for almost any paradigm (and not just those chosen by the paradigm), i.e. the user can enable
% and configure stages in the default pipeline which are normally disabled in the given paradigm. Note
% that flt_pipeline offers a few alias names for some parameters, e.g. 'channels' can be used
% instead of 'selchans', both controlling filters/flt_selchans; these are listed in flt_pipeline.
%
% The second stage of most paradigms is the Feature Extraction stage, which receives the
% preprocessed signals from the Signal Processing, and extracts certain informative features (e.g.
% logarithm of the signal power). This stage is usually custom to the paradigm, and is therefore
% controlled by unique parameters (e.g. 'patterns' in the Common Spatial Patterns [2] paradigm,
% para_csp).
%
% Finally, the feature produced by the Feature Extraction are usually subjected to a last stage, the
% Machine Learning. In this, a learning component, which is one of the provided
% machine_learning/ml_train* functions, computes a statistical model of the feature distributions,
% and their relation to the desired output values. This component is generally selected via the
% 'learner' parameter, which is exposed by most paradigms. The learner can be specified as name tag,
% such as 'lda', which refers to ml_trainlda. If the learner component contains parameters which shall
% be costomized as well, a cell array is passed which contains the name tag followed by the custom
% parameters, in the order of appearance in the respective learning function. For example,
% 'learner',{'svmlinear',0.5} selects The linear SVM component and sets its Cost parameter to 0.5,
% and 'learner',{'logreg',[],'variant','vb-ard'} selects the Logistic Regression component, keeps its
% first parameter at the default value, and uses the custom variant 'vb-ard', which stands for
% Variational Bayes with Automatic Relevance Determination (see, e.g., [7]). A small but useful subset
% of the provided Signal Processing, Feature Extraction and Machine Learning components is compactly
% described in [5].
%
%
% Customized Example
% ==================
%
% To obtain an online prediction of the working-memory load of a person, a calibration data set in
% which the person has to maintain varying numbers of items is his/her memory (e.g., using the
% n-back task, see [6]) can be used as a starting point. In this data set, conditions with one item
% in memory are marked with the event 'n1', conditions with two items in memory are marked with
% 'n2', etc. Assuming that working-memory load may be reflected in certain oscillatory processes,
% though in unknown locations and frequency bands, the paradigm Spec-CSP ([9]) is used as a basis.
% In its default configuration (see paradigms/ParadigmSpecCSP), it focuses on a relatively narrow
% frequency band, which shall be relaxed here (in particular, the theta band [10] should be
% included). Also, by default, the Spec-CSP paradigm selects data epochs at 0.5-3.5 seconds
% following each (selected) event, which shall be modified to [-2.5 2.5], to get a time coverage
% that is better adapted to the task. Finally, Spec-CSP by default contains a non-probabilistic
% classifier (Linear Discriminant Analysis, see machine_learning/ml_trainlda), which we want to
% change into a largely equivalent, but probabilistic one (Logistic regression, see
% machine_learning/ml_trainlogreg). Since we assume that the most important part of the spectrum
% will be the alpha and theta rhythm (peaked at ~10 and ~4Hz), but do not want to completely rule
% out other frequencies, we additionally impose a prior as a custom in-line (lambda) function of
% frequency). Since we have more than two classes, but the Spec-CSP is only defined for two classes,
% the framework automatically applies it to every pair of conditions and uses voting (see
% machine_learning/ml_trainvote) to arrive at per-class probabilities. Note that this is a major
% customization.
%
%   dataset = io_loadset('data sets/mary/nback.eeg')
%   myapproach = {'SpecCSP', ...
%       'SignalProcessing',{'EpochExtraction',[-2.5 2.5], 'FIRFilter',{'Frequencies',[2 4 33 34],'Type','minimum-phase'}}, ...
%       'Prediction',{'FeatureExtraction',{'SpectralPrior','@(f)1+exp(-(x-10).^2)+exp(-(x-4).^2'}, ...
%                     'MachineLearning',{'Learner','logreg'}}};
%   [loss,model,stats] = bci_train('Data',dataset, 'Approach',myapproach, 'TargetMarkers',{'n1','n2','n3'})
%
% This model will predict either 1,2, or 3 with high confidence, when the user is maintaining the
% respective number of items in his/her working memory, but will likely be fairly specific to the
% task on which it was calibrated.
%
%
% Parameter searching
% ===================
%
% In some cases, the optimal setting of certain parameters of a paradigm might not be known, but may
% drastically affect the performance of the method. One example are the time boundaries w.r.t. to
% the supplied events, which may depend on the reaction time of the user, among other things.
% Another example are regularization parameters which are used to constrain the complexity of the
% learned model (see, e.g. [11]). Regularization is a very powerful concept which enables methods
% such as Support Vector Machines and LASSO, in which the parameter is neither designed to be
% manually selected nor is it very interpretable in terms of brain processes. But most importantly,
% manual selection of these parameters (by trial and error) invalidates the performance guarantees
% that are made by the loss estimates: the performance estimate found for the hand-selected model is
% likely far better than the actual performance of that model. This is because the influence of
% random fluctuations in the estimate over the possible parameters is maximized by the user when
% he/she accepts the best one as the actual performance of the method (similar in spirit to the
% fallacy of multiple hypothesis tests without correction).
%
% For these reasons, bci_train offers a generic mechanism to search over parameters (or parameter
% combinations), in user-defined intervals and granularity, and uses a nested cross-validation
% method to give unbiased loss estimates. In this method, the search for the best parameter (using
% cross-validation derived estimates) is done inside an outer cross-validation, in each of its
% steps, and is restricted to the respective training set of that step. This way, the performance of
% the search procedure itself can be objectively evaluated on held-out test data. The
% cross-validation scheme for this inner search procedure can be specified via the OptimizationScheme
% parameter (part of the Training-Options), which has the same format as the EvaluationScheme
% parameter. By default, it is set to a 5-fold blockwise cross-validation with 5 trials safety
% margin. As a downside, parameter search multiplies the time it takes to compute a model by a
% potentially large factor; the total computation time of bci_train is (# of folds in the outer
% cross-validation) * (# of folds in the inner cross-validation) * (# of parameter combinations) *
% (time to compute a single model). Thus, the evaluation (outer) cross-validation may in some cases
% be turned off ('eval_scheme' set to 0) to obtain a model in a reasonable time, e.g., between a
% calibration session and a subsequent online session.
%
% Any value supplied to the paradigm can be replaced by a search range, written as search(...), to
% indicate to bci_train that this parameter is subject to a search. The search() clause can be used
% in any place of the data passed to the paradigm (e.g. inside cell arrays and/or structs), and can
% run over any data type supported by MATLAB, such as numbers, strings, structs, and vectors.
%
%
% Parameter Search Examples
% =========================
%
% In the case of imagined hand gestures (see first example), the time period in which the user
% performs the imaginations may not be known in advance (e.g. one user may imagine to clench the
% fist, while another user may imagine a whole sequence of finger movements). Therefore, the exact
% boundaries of the relevant data are not known, and can be searched (or spectral heuristics could
% be used). We assume that the response time of the user following the instruction may vary between
% 0.25 seconds and 0.75 seconds, and we choose to search over the range at a granualarity of 0.1
% seconds. The time it takes until the imagination is finished may vary between 1.5 seconds and 4.5
% seconds, and we search over values at a granularity of 0.5 seconds. Thus, para_csp's default
% 'epoch' parameter [0.5,3.5] is replaced by [search(0.25:0.1:0.75), search(1.5:0.5:4.5)]:
%
%   calib = io_loadset('data sets/john/gestures.eeg')
%   myapproach = {'CSP' 'SignalProcessing',{'EpochExtraction',[search(0.25:0.1:0.75),search(1.5:0.5:4.5)]}};
%   [loss,model,stats] = bci_train('Data',calib, 'Approach',myapproach}, 'TargetMarkers',{'left-imag','right-imag'})
%
% Since the search runs over 6*7 parameters, and a 5x inner cross-validation is performed, the
% overall running time will be 6*7*5 = 210x the default running time. If such a procedure shall be
% run immediately prior to an online session, it is better to disable the outer cross-validation
% altogether, which brings the time down to 21x of the default.
%
%
% As a second example, suppose that the goal is to predict whether the user perceives some event as
% being erroneous or not. A possible calibration data set could contain events of two classes, 'err'
% and 'cor', which encode time points where the user encountered errorneous and correct events. The
% assumption is that the user's event processing is accompanied by a characteristic slow cortical
% potential [12] which allows to discern between the two conditions. As a paradigm, we use the
% ERP version of the Dual-Agumented Lagrange method [13], which makes few assumptions
% except that the cognitive process of interest is simple enough in its time/space behavior to be
% tractably recognized. We restrict the analysis to the period of -0.2 to 0.65s around the event,
% resample to 60Hz, filter to ~0.3-19Hz, and specify a custom parameter search range for the DAL machine
% learning function. The complexity of the learned model is controlled via a regularization
% parameter, called Lambda. This parameter is the first user-accessible parameter in the learning
% function ml_traindal (its first two parameters are implicitly specified by the framework and
% contain the actual data; this contract holds for all other learning functions
% machine_learning/ml_train*, as well). Instead of specifying an ad hoc value here, we instead
% let bci_train search over a large feasible interval.
%
%   calib = io_loadset('data sets/john/errorperception.eeg')
%   myapproach = {'DALERP', ...
%       'SignalProcessing',{'EpochExtraction',[-0.2 0.65]}, ...
%       'Prediction',{'MachineLearning',{'Learner',{'dal',search(2.^(8:-0.125:1))}}}};
%   [loss,model,stats] = bci_train('Data',calib,'Approach',myapproach, 'TargetMarkers',{'err','cor'})
%
% This example is for illustrative purposes because the ml_traindal has its own highly optimized
% parameter search code, which would kick in if the first parameter was specified as an array of
% possible values (i.e. without the search() clause).
%
% Statistics
% ==========
%
% Aside from an average loss measure, a structure of additional statistics can be obtained from
% bci_train via its third output parameter, Statistics. The most relevant part of the statistics are
% the per-fold loss measures (computed in each cross-validation fold), which can be used to run
% statistical tests on the significance of outcomes, etc.; these are in the struct array .per_fold.
% This also includes the target values (.targ) and predicted values (.pred) for the trials in each
% fold, as well as the indices of the fold's trials in the full original data set (.indices).
% Depending on the type of loss measure, additional values may be available per fold (e.g. fraction
% of true and false positives, etc).
%
% If the model was obtained in a parameter search, the field .modelsearch contains the complete set of
% loss measures and computed models for each tested parameter combination (on the entire calibration
% set), which includes, among others, the regularization path for regularized classifiers, which
% allows for very detailed analyses of the computed models.
%
% Additional fields include, depending on the type of target variables, .classes and .class_ratio
% contain the possible output values of the model (e.g. [1,2,3,4,5] in a  standard 5-class
% classification task) as well as the fraction of data trials belonging to each class. The field
% .model contains the computed model, the field .expression contains an expression data structure
% which summarizes the parameters that went into the comptuation of the result(s), including those
% that determined the data set(s) used for calibration. The function hlp_tostring can format it into
% a human-readable string.
%
%
% Model Usage
% ===========
%
% The computed model can subsequently be used with other parts of the toolbox. Most importantly, the
% model can be used with the online system of the toolbox, either via one of the provided online
% plugins or directly through BCILAB's online application programming interface (API), explained in
% online_analysis/onl_*. Aside from online analysis, the model can be used for offline analysis of
% data sets, via the functions bci_predict (make predictions for every trial in a given data set),
% onl_stream (make predictions for desired time points in a given data set), and bci_preproc
% (preprocess a given data set into its pre-feature extraction form for analysis and visualization
% with EEGLAB tools). Finally, model properties can be visualized and inspected using visualization
% methods (visualizations/vis_*). The model can be saved to disk and re-loaded later.
%
%
% In:
%    --- core arguments ---
%
%    Data : Data set. EEGLAB data set, or stream bundle, or cell array of data sets / stream bundles
%           to use for calibration/evaluation.
%
%    Approach : Computational approach. Specification of a computational approach (usually a cell
%               array, alternatively a struct). If a cell array, the first cell is the name of the
%               paradigm (usually just the acronym of an existing ParadigmXXX class), and the rest are
%               name-value pairs specifying optional custom arguments for the paradigm.
%
%   TargetMarkers : Target markers. List of types of those markers around which data shall be used
%                   for BCI calibration; each marker type encodes a different target class (i.e.
%                   desired output value) to be learned by the resulting BCI model.
%
%                   This can be specified either as a cell array of marker-value pairs, in which
%                   case each marker type of BCI interest is associated with a particular BCI output
%                   value (e.g., -1/+1), or as a cell array of marker types (in which case each
%                   marker will be associated with its respective index as corresponding BCI output
%                   value, while nested cell arrays are also allowed to group markers that correspond
%                   to the same output value). See help of set_targetmarkers for further explanation.
%
%
%   --- computational settings ---
%
%   EvaluationMetric : Evaluation metric. The metric to use in the assessment of model performance
%                      (via cross-validation). Can be empty, a string, or a function handle.
%                      See ml_calcloss() for the options (default: [] = auto-select between
%                      kullback-leibler divergence ('kld'), mean square error ('mse'), mis-classification
%                      rate ('mcr') and negative log-likelihood ('nll') depending on the type of the
%                      target and prediction variables, further detailed in ml_calcloss())
%
%   EvaluationScheme : Evaluation scheme. Cross-validation scheme to use for evaluation. See
%                      utl_crossval for the default settings when operating on a single recording
%                      (there it is called 'scheme'). When opperating on a collection of multiple
%                      data sets, this is equivalent to the Settings argument of
%                      utl_collection_partition (see that function for details). In the case of
%                      single data sets, a reasonable choice for final results is {'chron',10,5}
%                      which stands for 10-fold chronological/blockwise cross-validation with 5
%                      trials margin between training and test sets. Default: {'chron',5,5}, which
%                      is twice as fast, for more rapid workflow. A standard choice in machine
%                      learning is 10-fold randomized cross-validation, which you get by setting
%                      this parameter to 10 (though it is not ideal for time-series data).
%                      Use the special value 0 or 'off' to disable the outer cross-validation.
%
%   OptimizationScheme : Optimization scheme. Cross-validation scheme to use for parameter search
%                        (this is a nested cross-validation, only performed if there are parameters
%                        to search). The format is the same as in EvaluationScheme; default is
%                        {'chron',5,5}, which is a reasonable choice for final results.
%
%   GoalIdentifier : Goal identifier. This is used when training a model on a collection of
%                    multiple recordings that will subsequently be used to predict given a dataset
%                    that is somehow related to the training set (e.g., one of the subjects). It
%                    serves to identify the data set on which the BCI shall eventually be used and
%                    is a struct that has fields like 'subject', 'session', 'day' (e.g., the Subject
%                    Id, Day, etc. of the goal data set); for further details, see
%                    utl_collection_closest, which interprets these parameters to determine what
%                    data in the collection is most relevant to the future test dataset. Note that
%                    when one does not actually plan to use the trained model on new data (as is
%                    often the case), it might be most efficient to just set the GoalIdentifier to
%                    identify one of the recordings (e.g., {'subject',1}) since otherwise the final
%                    model produced by bci_train would be trained in a way that's agnostic to which
%                    is the future subject, and that can be quite time-consuming for some methods.
%
%   --- selective computation ---
%
%   PerFoldModels : Collect per-fold models. If true, models of each fold of the cross-validation
%                   will be collected (uses more memory). (default: false)
%
%   ComputeFinalModel : Whether to compute the final model. If false, the resulting model will be
%                       empty. (default: true)
%
%   NoPrechecks : Disable pre-checks. This will skip sanity checks of the data prior to launching
%                 the actual computation. When the CV is run on a cluster on a large dataset, this
%                 can save significant loading time. (default: false)
%
%   CacheFoldResults : Whether to cache the per-fold results. This is meant to be used when running
%                      very long-running computations on machines that crash frequently enough that
%                      partial results need to be saved. In this case, any previously computed
%                      results will be loaded from disk. Under normal conditions caching only
%                      sub-computations necessary for the cross-validation (which is enabled by
%                      default) should be enough. Implies NoPrechecks. (default: false)
%
%   OnlyCachedResults : Load only results that are in the cache. This will not run any computations.
%                       Implies CacheFoldResults. (default: false)
%
%   --- parallel computing options ---
%
%   CrossvalidationResources : Cross-validation parallelization. Same meaning and options as the
%                              ParameterSearchEngine parameter, however for the cross-validations.
%                              By default set to 'global'.
%
%   ParameterSearchResources : Parameter search parallelization. If set to 'global', the global BCILAB
%                              setting (see par_globalsetting) will be used to determine when to run
%                              this computation. If set to 'local', the computation will be done on
%                              the local machine. Otherwise,the respective scheduler will be used to
%                              distribute the computation across a cluster (default: 'local')
%
%   NestedCrossvalResources : Nested cross-validation parallelization. If set to 'global', the
%                             global BCILAB setting will be used (see par_globalsetting) to
%                             determine when to run this computation. If set to 'local', the
%                             computation will be done on the local machine. Otherwise,the
%                             respective scheduler will be used to distribute the computation across
%                             a cluster (default: 'local')
%
%   ResourcePool : Parallel compute resouces. If set to ''global'', the globally set BCILAB resource
%                  pool will be used (see par_globalsetting), otherwise this should be a cell array
%                  of 'hostname:port' strings (default: 'global')
%
%   --- miscellaneous options ---
%
%   EpochBounds : Epoch bounds override. Tight upper bound of epoch windows used for epoching (by
%                 default [-5 5]). This is only used if the cross-validation needs to run on
%                 continuous data because a continuous-data statistic needs to be computed over the
%                 training set (such as ICA).
%
%   EventField : Event field to search for target markers, provided as a string. If not provided,
%                the field 'type' will be used by default.
%
%   PruneDatasets : Prune datasets from results. If true, any occurrence of a data set in the
%                   resulting model or stats struct will be replaced by its symbolic expression or a
%                   placeholder string. (default: true)
%
%   PruneNontargetMarkers : Prune non-target markers. This usually improves the speed of offline
%                           processing at the cost of not being able to access misc markers in BCI
%                           analysis. (default: false)
%
%   EnforceFingerprinting : Enforce use of fingerprinting. If true, this function will not accept
%                           raw dataset structs if fingerprinting is disabled. (default: true)
%
%   TolerateExceptions : Tolerate and suppress exceptions during training. The affected folds will
%                        be excluded from the statistics. (default: false)
%
% Out:
%   Loss       : a measure of the overall performance of the paradigm combination, w.r.t. to the
%                target variable returned by gettarget, computed by the specified loss metric.
%
%   Model      : a predictive model ("detector"), as computed by the specified paradigm; can be
%                loaded into the online system via onl_loaddetector, applied offline to new data via
%                bci_predict, and analyzed using various visualizers
%
%   Statistics : additional statistics, as produced by the specified metric; if the model itself is
%                determined via parameter search, further statistics from the model searching are in
%                the subfield stats.model
%
% Examples:
%   % assuming that a data set has been loaded, and a computational approach has been defined
%   % similarly to the following code:
%   traindata = io_loadset('bcilab:/userdata/tutorial/imag_movements1/calib/DanielS001R01.dat');
%   myapproach = {'CSP' 'SignalProcessing',{'EpochExtraction',[0 3.5]}};
%
%   % learn a model and get the mis-classification rate, as well as statistics
%   [trainloss,lastmodel,laststats] = bci_train('Data',traindata,'Approach',myapproach,'TargetMarkers',{'StimulusCode_2','StimulusCode_3'});
%
%   % as before, but use a coarser block-wise (chronological) cross-validation (5-fold, with 3 trials margin)
%   [trainloss,lastmodel,laststats] = bci_train('Data',traindata,'Approach',myapproach,'EvaluationScheme',{'chron',5,3}'TargetMarkers',{'StimulusCode_2','StimulusCode_3'});
%
%   % as before, but use a 10-fold randomized cross-validation (rarely recommended)
%   [trainloss,lastmodel,laststats] = bci_train('Data',traindata,'Approach',myapproach,'EvaluationScheme',10,'TargetMarkers',{'StimulusCode_2','StimulusCode_3'});
%
%   % as before, using a 10-fold, 10x repeated randomized cross-validation
%   [trainloss,lastmodel,laststats] = bci_train('Data',traindata,'Approach',myapproach,'EvaluationScheme',[10 10],'TargetMarkers',{'StimulusCode_2','StimulusCode_3'});
%
%   % using a different loss measure (here: mean-square error, instead of the default mis-classification rate)
%   [trainloss,lastmodel,laststats] = bci_train('Data',traindata,'Approach',myapproach,'EvaluationMetric','mse','TargetMarkers',{'StimulusCode_2','StimulusCode_3'});
