function model = ml_traincov(varargin)
% Learn a linear predictive model using covariance-based classification.
% Model = ml_traincov(Trials, Targets, Options...)
%
% This method assumes that the given trials values represent covariance matrices and offers various
% methods, including information geometric approaches, to classify them. This implementation uses
% the covariance toolbox by Alexandre Barachant.
%
% In:
%   Trials       : training data, as in ml_train
%
%   Targets      : target variable, as in ml_train
%
% Out:
%   Model   : the predictive model; can be used with ml_predictcov
%
% Examples:
%   % learn a model using the defaults
%   model = ml_traincov(trials,targets);
%
